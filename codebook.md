###National Emissions Inventory    
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. For each year, the number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year is recorded.    

The analysis plots are based on the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. 

####Variables:
* fips: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county                  
* SCC: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)           
* Pollutant: A string indicating the pollutant           
* Emissions: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons            
* type: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)              
* year: The year of emissions recorded
